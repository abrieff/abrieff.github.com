==================
On this project, I correctly implemented the three html documents ( a resume, a bio, and a homepage(index)) and 
styled them seperatly for two different devices - mobile and desktop.
Unfortunately, I could not seem to get the mobile css to work right - it kept loading the desktop css file instead. 
I did not work or collaborate with anyone on this project beyond searching for tips and guides to using html and css online.
This project took me about 5 hours to complete - I am definately struggling with getting everything to work correctly.
